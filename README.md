Problem-Statement  

PIN Cracking: Develop innovative and efficient methods to crack a 6-digit PIN using Brute Force Attack   
techniques, MitM Attack, Exploiting Vulnerabilities, Side Channel Attack.  
Challenge:  
➢ Devise efficient to crack the 6-digit PIN within limited attempts or time constraints.  
➢ Bypass the Devices additional security layers.  

we have used created methods for two different scenarios, 

1] for later versions of android which have `locksettings.db` refer to Submission.pdf  
2] for older versions of android which use .key files to store sha-256 hash of the pin we use brute-force medthod
